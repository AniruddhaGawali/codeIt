## Usage of the "cpp" Folder

This folder is dedicated to C++ programs. Here are some guidelines and best practices for using this folder:

### Adding New Programs

1. To add a new C++ program, create a new `.cpp` file in this folder.

2. Name your file descriptively to reflect the purpose of the program (e.g., `calculator.cpp`).

3. Ensure your code is well-documented with comments, describing the program's functionality, input, and output.

### Editing Existing Programs

1. If you're making changes to an existing program, please make sure to follow these steps:

2. Create a branch for your changes. This helps in isolating and managing updates.

3. Document the changes you're making, including the reason for the change.

4. Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they don't introduce errors or break existing functionality.

5. Make sure your code adheres to coding conventions and styles used in this repository.

### Guidelines

- Avoid duplicating code: If a similar functionality already exists, consider reusing or modifying it instead of creating redundant code.

- Follow the project's coding standards, which may include naming conventions, indentation, and comment formatting.

- Prioritize code readability and maintainability. Use meaningful variable and function names.

### Best Practices

- Use version control: Commit your changes to a version control system (e.g., Git) and consider creating pull requests for collaborative development.

- Keep your programs modular and well-organized. Break down complex tasks into functions for easier maintenance.

- Consider writing unit tests for critical functions to ensure code reliability.

- Make use of the README files in specific program folders to provide additional information about each program.
